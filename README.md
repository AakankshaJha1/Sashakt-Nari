## Problem
<p>Despite the increasing number of women entering the workforce, many women, especially stay-at-home mothers and those living in rural areas, still face significant barriers to financial independence and career advancement. 
These women often have unique skills and talents that could contribute to local economies, but lack access to opportunities and markets for their products and services. As a result, they are often stuck in a cycle of poverty and dependence, unable to fully realize their potential and support themselves and their families.
</p>

## Solution Proposed
Our website connects homemakers with manufacturers, offering a platform for women to turn their skills and interests into a source of income. With a user-friendly interface, women can easily search for work that aligns with their abilities, receive fair payment for their services, and gain financial independence. By breaking down barriers and providing access to opportunities, our website empowers women to build a better future for themselves and their families.
